# General notes for similar projects:

For setting it up:
    npx create-react-app my-app
    npm audit fix

For navigation:
    npm install --save react-router-dom  
(NOT react-router --> that's the core, and not react-router-native unless needed)

For React-Redux, for easier management of lots of states, network requests, and more:
    npm install --save redux react-redux axios redux-thunk
    npm install --save lodash
Lodash helps deal with arrays/objects used in Action Creators / Reducers, memoizing functions

For installing Redux Form, see [some notes](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/learn/lecture/24215118#questions) from the course.  If using Node v15 and npm v7, run this:
    npm install redux-form --legacy-peer-deps
Otherwise for older versions:
    npm install --save redux-form
...should avoid errors.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
